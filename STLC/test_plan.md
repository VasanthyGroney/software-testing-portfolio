# Test Plan for Webshop New Features  
  
## 1. Analyze the Product  
  
 ### Objective  
  
  To ensure the new features of the webshop meet functional, performance, security, and usability requirements, providing a seamless experience for end users.  
  
 ## User Base

## New Features:

-   Discount coupon functionality.
    
-   Wishlist creation.
    
-   Product recommendation engine.
    
-   Enhanced product reviews (with media upload).
    


### 2. Design the Test Strategy

#### Scope of Testing

-   In Scope:
    
    -   All existing functionalities.
        
    -   New features: discount coupons, wishlist, product recommendation engine, and enhanced reviews.
        
-   Out of Scope:
    
    -   Backend service maintenance unrelated to new features.
        

#### Type of Testing

-   Functional Testing.
    
-   Regression Testing.
    
-   Integration Testing.
    
-   Usability Testing.
    
-   Performance Testing.
    
-   Security Testing.
    
-   User Acceptance Testing (UAT).
    

#### Risks and Issues

-   **Delays in development:** Mitigation: Buffer period in the schedule.
    
-   **Lack of test data:** Mitigation: Create mock data sets.
    
-   **Resource unavailability:** Mitigation: Identify backup resources.
    

#### Test Logistics

**Team Roles:**

-   Jane Smith - Test Manager.
    
-   John Doe - QA Engineer (Functional and Regression Testing).
    
-   Alice Johnson - QA Engineer (Performance and Security Testing).
    
-   Robert Brown - QA Engineer (Usability Testing).
    
-   Maria Garcia - End User for UAT.
### 4. Define Test Criteria

#### Suspension Criteria

-   Testing will pause if critical defects block further testing.
    
-   Lack of necessary resources or failure of the test environment.
    

#### Exit Criteria

-   All planned tests executed.
    
-   **Run Rate:** At least 95% of test cases executed.
    
-   **Pass Rate:** At least 90% of executed test cases passed.
    
-   All critical/high-priority defects resolved and closed.
    
-   Performance and security standards met.
    
-   UAT completed and signed off.
